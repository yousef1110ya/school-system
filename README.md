# school system

in this repo i am creating a schoool system from scrach and creating some basic functions , and i am editing the readme file as i improve the project into a better version of it .  
as for now the main functions are :

-   user login and token auth

    ## user login

    in this section i have created a simple and easy login system using sanctom:auth middleware that is the default one with laravel
